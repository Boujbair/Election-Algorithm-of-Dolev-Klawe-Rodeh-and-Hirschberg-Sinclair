# Election-Algorithm-of-Dolev-Klawe-Rodeh-and-Hirschberg-Sinclair
Election Algorithms try to guarantee a high availability of a leader who maintains the
coordination tasks. In this project, we will discuss the different algorithms and election methods used for
a variety of problems and distinct architectures such as Algorithm-of-Dolev-Klawe-Rodeh and Algorithm of Hirschberg-Sinclair.
